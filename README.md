# OpenApi 3 playground

OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) is a standard for API documentation that allows developers to describe the structure and behavior of an API through a file in JSON or YAML format. This facilitates integration with API clients and ensures consistent usage of the API.

This project aims to integrate the openapi-validator, swagger-ui-express, and swagger-cli libraries to facilitate the development and documentation process for the API.

## express-openapi-validator

express-openapi-validator is a middleware for Express that allows incoming requests and outgoing responses of an API to be validated based on a specified OpenAPI file.

## swagger-ui-express

swagger-ui-express is a middleware for Express that allows the integration of the Swagger user interface into a Node.js project. This allows developers and end users to easily access the API documentation through a web page.

## swagger-cli

Finally, swagger-cli is a command-line tool that allows multiple OpenAPI files to be combined into a single file and validates that the API definition file conforms to the OpenAPI 3 specification.
